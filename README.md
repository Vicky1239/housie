# Prerequisite
Ruby should be installed on the syaytem to run

# Housie
A version of Bingo played in the UK and some other countries is called "Housie". Each ticket shows exactly 15 numbers, and in each ticket every number from 1 to 90 is used exactly once.

A ticket is a grid of 3 rows by 9 columns.

# Rules:
1. The first column contains numbers from 1 to 9; the second column numbers from 10 to 19; the third 20 to 29 and so on up until the last column, which contains numbers from 80 to 90.

2. Each column contains one, two or three numbers, in increasing order downwards. Each row contains exactly 5 numbers (and hence 4 blanks).

# Challenge
Write a Ruby program to generate random Housie tickets. The Ruby program must have a single function that one can call and it should print out the housie ticket on a console in a simple readable format. (blanks can be shown as X)


# Genarate Ticket
1. Clone repo housie
2. cd housie
3. ruby housie.rb

Run the file Housie.rb with ruby to get the output

# ruby housie.rb

Attached file housie_output is the sample output generated using the housie.rb
